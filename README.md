Lakefront Trail Conditions
==========================

A website that displays current and recent reports from Twitter about the Chicago Lakefront Trail conditions so bicyclists have quick and easy access to information about congestion, events, and icy pavement. 

The hashtag #chiLFT is used to report to the public conditions about the Lakefront Trail, the city's most popular bike route that stretches 18 miles from Hollywood Avenue in Edgewater on the north side to 71st Street in South Shore on the south side.
